        "We’ve added a handful of new items and gears that will make your Temtem journey more enjoyable:Coward’s Blanket: While this item is active, the whole Squad will receive experience points and TVs from a PvE battle. You already know Coward’s Cloak; this one is similar, but affects the whole squad instead of just one Temtem. Once obtained, you can activate or deactivate the Coward’s Blanket any time you wish.Learning Aid: While this consumable item is active, the experience points you earn in a battle are multiplied by two. We know that leveling up in Temtem is not in its brightest spot right now, so we hope that this item, and the additional change on untamed experience, will help improve the situation a bit. While this item is currently locked behind certain loot pools, we plan to add easier access to this item in the future with the arrival of the endgame island.👥TemSpotter: While this consumable item is active, untamed Tems will display a special icon on their combat UI if they have one or more Stats with 49 or 50 SVs. This community suggested item should speed up and facilitate the hunt of good specimens for breeding.👥Ignoramus Cloak: A new Gear item that will prevent a Temtem from receiving Experience Points or TVs from a battle. Another community-suggested item!👥Fruit Smoothies: These new treats will increase or remove 50 TVs of a Stat. Smoothies are so far the most cost-efficient way of training Temtem TVs, and they can be purchased at any time from the new fruit vendor located in Arbury.👥Spirits’ Favor: And the last community suggested item of the batch, Spirit’s Favor provides one free entry to any Mythical Lair. They can currently drop from Wishing Wells, and they’ll help with running lairs in a more cost-efficient way.X-Incubator and Y-Incubator Gender Boost Tickets: These items increase the likelihood of the Gender ratios by 50% on any Temtem egg being opened in an Incubator. To give you an example: if you were to breed a Ganki, and used an X-Incubator Ticket on the egg, the offspring would have a 75% chance of being a female, instead of its usual 50%. If you were to breed Oree and used a Y-Incubator Ticket on the offspring, it would have a 37.5% of being a male, instead of its usual 25%.",
